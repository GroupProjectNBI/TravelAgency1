# CODERULES AND STRATEGIES 
**Prioritization of the backlog in projects,**
 so we get an overview of what needs to be done and when.
We also need to set up rules regarding the project, such as code rules, AI, when PRs should be done, code comments (in English) if needed, README, documentation (in English), variable names, self-documenting code, regarding concepts that we have not covered in school, how we structure the work over the days.
If you come up with more, we need to write these down today so that we can start on the structure later.

**We also need to plan and organize our database.**
